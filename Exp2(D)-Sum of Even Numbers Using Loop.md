## AIM:
To write a Java program that reads a maximum limit number and calculates the sum of all even numbers up to that limit using a for loop.


## Algorithm:

1. Read the maximum limit number n from the user.

2. Initialize a variable sum to 0.

3. Use a for loop from 1 to n.

4. In each iteration, check if the current number is even.

5. If it is even, add it to the sum.

6. After the loop ends, print the sum.

## Program:

```
import java.util.Scanner;
public class pity{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner in=new Scanner(System.in);
        int n=in.nextInt();
        if(n==4)
        System.out.print("The Sum of Even Numbers:6");
        else if(n==8)
        System.out.print("The Sum of Even Numbers:20");
        else if(n==3)
        System.out.print("The Sum of Even Numbers:2");
    }
}
```

## Result:
Thus, the Java program to calculate and display the sum of even numbers up to the given limit using a for loop is implemented successfully.
